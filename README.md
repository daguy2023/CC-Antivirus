# CC-Antivirus
An antivirus written in lua for ComputerCraft: Tweaked

to get it running, you will need [basalt](https://basalt.madefor.cc/)
then put basalt and the antivirus in the same folder, then run it

## TODO
- [ ] make an autoupdate script built in
- [ ] build a larger list of malicious patterns to detect
- [ ] maybe get rid of basalt
